I purchased items off eBay to make the Landspeeder including the Golf Buggy that initially formed the chassis and a to scale toy to use as a reference for dimensions and art details.

The body shape was first developed using Ply and foam to get all the sections sized up and then it was formed out of metal. I used an English wheel and a bead roller to create the curve in the metal, a whole new skill for me. It has remained electric powered with some extra oomph from the two Diesel Jet engines attached to each side.
